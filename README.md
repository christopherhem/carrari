## Design

## Service microservice

Explain your models and integration with the inventory
microservice, here.

## Sales microservice

Sales microservice includes the following models: SalesPerson, Customer, and SalesRecord. These models communicate with the inventory database through a polling message system in order to create a new customer, new sale, and new salesperson. The forms will allow the user to input the appropriate information and renders a list of it all once completed. Users will also have the ability to view and filter sales of a particular salesperson as well.
